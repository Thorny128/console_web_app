        <p>Visual Studio code is a software made for programming. Once you have it installed, you can code in any popular language. It has tons of plugins and supports hundreds of languages, and is made by one of the largest companies ever, Microsoft.</p>
        <p>Setting up is easy, just follow the instructions on the installer. You can create a folder with index.html, style.css, and main.js, and start making websites, like I am!</p>

        <h1>How to use the Console to debug your code</h1>
        <p>The console is a very useful tool to debug your code. You can access it by right clicking on nowhere in the page, clicking inspect, and clicking Console. After certain parts in your code, putting console.log to say "Action #1 done" or "Link copied" will help debug your code if something goes wrong, and you don't know where. It will seem like a burden early on, but it may save you hours of debugging later on if you make a mistake. Take it from me - you want to be using the console.</p>
        <h3>Try opening the console now. You should see a name and a number there.</h3>
        <h2>Now click on this button, and check the console after you do it.</h2>
        <button onclick="Click()">Click Me!</button>
        <p>Notice anything? Yup, events in the console. One example of using this in debugging is if the text didn't appear. You would know that something is wrong in the code regarding the button, and instead of debugging the whole program, you would just need to debug the button code. It saves so much time!</p>
        <h2>Try it yourself! Make some code and use the console to log events! Try using buttons, links, and more to trigger console events! Then, ask a parent or friend to mess up some part of the code, and watch the console help you debug!</h2>
